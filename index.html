                        History of the Internet

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The first question that pops into your mind is probably, “Who started the internet?”. The
                            Internet was developed by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf in the 1970s. They began the design of what
                            we today know as the ‘internet.’</p>

                        <p> It was the result of another research experiment which was
                            called ARPANET, which stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. This was
                            initially supposed to be a communications system for the Defense Team of the United States
                            of America - a network that would also survive a nuclear attack. </p>

                        <p>It eventually became a
                            successful nationwide experimental packet network. But when was the first Internet started?
                            It is believed that on 6 August 1991, when the World Wide Web opened to the public.</p>

                        <p>Note : While reading this internet history it sounds like its a wast thing but dont you worry
                            its
                            not really a wast thing.</p>
